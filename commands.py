# add your commands here, they must follow pyinfra's syntax!
# you cannot just add `sudo apt update` or other in here. 
# if you want to do that then run `pyinfra hosts.py exec -- your-command-here`
# if you need sudo privalages then `pyinfra hosts.py --sudo exec -- your-command-here`
# for pyinfras syntax, see their docs page: https://docs.pyinfra.com
# for an example for apt see: https://github.com/Fizzadar/pyinfra/blob/2.x/examples/apt.py
